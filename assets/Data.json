    "Description": "Apple scab is a fungal disease that affects the leaves and fruit of apple trees. The disease causes brown or black discoloration and lesions on the leaves, which can lead to defoliation. In severe cases, the fruit may also be affected, resulting in unsightly scabby lesions. The disease is most commonly seen in areas with cool, wet springs.",
    "Cure": "Treatment for apple scab typically involves the use of fungicides. These fungicides can be applied as a preventive measure before the onset of the disease, or as a curative treatment after the disease has been detected. In addition to fungicides, pruning and destroying infected leaves and fruit can also help to control the spread of the disease. Cultural practices such as good sanitation, proper irrigation and fertilization, and selecting disease-resistant cultivars can also be helpful in managing apple scab.",

The use of antibiotics and copper-based fungicides can also be an effective means of controlling the disease. Applications should be made at regular intervals throughout the growing season, starting at seedling stage and continuing until harvest. Properly timing antibiotic and copper applications is critical to achieving good control of bacterial spot. In addition, avoiding overhead irrigation and promoting good air circulation within the canopy can also help to reduce bacterial spot development.",
